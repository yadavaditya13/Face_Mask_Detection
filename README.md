# Face_Mask_Detection

This project does the task of classifying faces as "Mask" and "No Mask".
The directory contains a "model_train.ipynb" file that trains the model "mask-detector" for the task.
Then there are three scipts that will use this model along with face-detector pre_trained model to do the desired task in image, live_Cam and video_File as well. 

Note: If you have some issues regrading detecting faces try providing different confidence values to the scripts before running them.
